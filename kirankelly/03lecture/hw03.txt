 HW03

OBJECTIVE:
 Solve a 3 variable system of equations by reducing rows to 
 isolate the variables.

HINT:
 Operate on the system's coefficients by scaling the constants
 and adding rows together until you have two unique equations
 with only two variables. From there, you can you can solve the 
 2-var system and use the results to solve for the third and final variable.

EXAMPLE: 
   2x - 3y + 2z =  20 //EQ1
  -5x - 2y + 9z =  2  //EQ2
   1x + 4y + 3z = -10 //EQ3

 Apply row reduction techniques to obtain a 2-var/2-EQ system:
  -10x + 15y - 10z = -100
    0x + 19y - 28z = -104 
    0x + 55y + 20z = -200
   (HINT: notice -10 is an L.C.M. & EQ2 and EQ3 only has 2 vars.

 Cancel the y-term in EQ3 to obtain Reduced Row Echelon Form:
  -10x +   15y -   10z = -100
    0x + 1045y - 1540z = -5720
    0x +    0y - 1920z = -1920


REQUIREMENTS:
1. Declare 12 double variables to hold the initial values for 
   each coeeficient in the system. (ex: int x3, y3, z3, s3;)
2. Prompt the user for each coefficient and store the provided
   values respectively within the 12 decalred variables.
3. Declare and initialize three double arrays using the 
   coeficients form each equation. (ex: int eq3 = {x3,y3,z3,s3};)
4. Using a FOR LOOP, scale each equation to create equal 
   x-coefficients within all equations.
5. Create two unique equations with only y and z by subtracting 
   equations in order to eliminate the x-term.
6. Solve the new 2 variable sub-system two obtain the numeric 
   values for y and z
7. Plug the 2 known variables into an equation and solve for z,
   the third and final variable. 
8. Print the results for x, y, and z.


SOLUTIONS:
 (ex) [3,-4,1]
