 HW 02

DESCRIPTION:
 There are two main ways to solve a system of equations: 
 SUBSTITION and ROW REDUCTION (elimination).
 We will focus on Row Reduction to create a general algorithm
 that acheives Reduced Row Echelon form (rref on a  calculator).

OBJECTIVE:
 Write a program that solves 2 variable systems of equations
 when given the coefficients of both equations.

Remember: When operating on a system of equations, 
 you are allowed to multiply by a coefficient 
 OR add and subtract two equations.

EXAMPLE:
 A typical problem will begin in the form:
  2x - 3y = 18
 -5x - 2y = -7

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Prompt the user for the coefficients from each equation.
2. Determine which constansts, when multiplied to an 
   equation, will result in matching x-coefficients.
3. Subtract the equations to cancel the x-term 
   and isolate a y-coeff.
4. Solve for y from the new equation.
5. Use y to solve for x.
6. Print the results for x and y.

BONUS:
 Explore the functions on a graphing calculator that 
 solve more complex systems of equations through
 matrix manipulation.

PRACTICE:
 (1) 1x - 7y = -11
     5x + 2y = -18

 (2) 7x - 8y = -16
    -4x + 2y =  4

 (3) 3x +  9y =  15
    -4x - 12y = -20

 (4)  6x - 5y = 4
    -12x + 2y = 8

 (5) -2x + 10y = -16 
      5x - 25y =  40

 (6) 2x + 3y = 20
     7x + 2y = 53 


SOLUTIONS: [x,y]
 (ex) [3,-4]
 (1)  [-4,1]
 (2)  [0,2]
 (3)  [2,1]
 (4)  [-1,-2]
 (5)  [-7,-3]
 (6)  [7,2]
