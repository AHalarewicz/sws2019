HW 02

Write a program that solves a 2 variable system of equations
when given the coefficients of both equations.

Remember: When operating on a system of equations, 
 you are allowed to multiply by a coefficient 
 OR add  and subtract two equations

A typical problem will begin in the form:

a1*X + b1*Y = c1
a2*X + b2*Y = c2

Prompt the user for the coefficients from each equation.
Multiply each equation by constants until the 
 leading coefficients equal eachother.
Subtract the equations to cancel the x-coeffs 
 and isolate a y-coeff.
Solve for y from the new equation.
Use y to solve for x.
Print the results for x and y.
